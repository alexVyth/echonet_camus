## Purpose
This is a biomedical data project to merge Echonet and Camus datasets that share a lot of common tasks. Specifically EF Prediction and heart's Left Ventricle segmentation.
Also it is a try to exploit new conclusions with the combination of the two datasets and also for each one separately.

## Information
The project has been forked from https://github.com/echonet/dynamic and the feature for Camus dataset loading has been implemented, without breaking original Echonet Dynamic code features.

Also a new 2DCNN - LSTM architecture has been engineered for the EF regression task. For more information visit https://github.com/echonet/dynamic.
